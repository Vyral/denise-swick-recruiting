There are three key things an agent should do in order to become a top-producer in the industry:

**1\. Follow a consistent schedule.** This is the hardest thing for an independent contractor to do because for them, there’s no one to hold them accountable for coming into work at a specific time or to get any particular results. Even in a regular job, there are certain, measurable things that you have to do every day, and unfortunately, the independent contractor setup takes away a lot of natural accountability. If people wonder why real estate agents don’t have more paychecks, it’s because they’re not following a reasonable schedule that both allows time for their business and their personal lives.

**2\. Lead-generate consistently.** Not everyone likes to pick up the phone and make calls to prospects like a telemarketer, as I have for 20 years. However, there are other forms of lead-generating methods out there. Whatever you choose to do to generate your leads, whether it’s a farm, phone prospecting, or a social media campaign, make sure that you are doing it consistently. For example, if you decide to buy your leads from Zillow, don’t just buy them for one month and then stop because you go too busy. Real estate, like any job, is a funnel—the more you put in, the more opportunities and leads you’ll get back from it.

One of my first business coaches once said, “There are people that you know and people that you don’t know: Which group is bigger?” The group of people that I don’t know is much bigger than the group that I do know, so I had to go out and learn how to talk to people.

**3\. Constantly and aggressively follow up with leads.** Once you learn to talk to people and you start getting leads and opportunities, you have got to follow up on it. Sometimes it can literally take three to seven conversations to get a buyer or a seller to say ‘yes’; depending on where they are in the process, it could take more or less.&nbsp;

Our definition of a qualified lead is someone who is willing to undergo a transaction with us and wants to do so within the next 30 days. Given that, we have a pretty strict follow-up schedule; we don’t want the dead weight to cloud all of the other golden opportunities that are out there.

Most agents are independent contractors—they’re not on teams, they’re not in an environment that supports accountability. Taking today’s three qualities of a top agent to heart will absolutely help bring your career from failure to success.
