<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

<p>Dear Fellow Agent:</p>

<p>Need direction and focus to sell more homes?</p>

<p>I’ll meet with you one-on-one to help you write a business plan you can implement immediately to generate leads, appointments, and sales. </p>

<p><strong>I know how challenging it is to sell real estate.</strong></p>

<p>You have discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of ways to get clients (all are not equal, I’ll tell you).</p>

<p>It can get overwhelming to stick to a consistent business plan that makes you money.</p>

<p>My name is Denise Swick and we’ve sold thousands of homes. </p>

<p>I want to help you sell more homes.</p>

<p>I’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. I’m happy to offer my insight on what I would do in your situation to sell more homes.</p>

<p>I will also share with you what we’re doing that works to generate leads and sales. </p>

<p>Once I understand how you like to do business that’s authentic to you (referral, prospecting, marketing, events, etc), I’ll help you write a business plan tailored just for you.</p>

<p>You’ll walk away with a plan of action, with steps you can take right away, to find homeowners who will list their home with you. </p>

<p>This will help you get the commission consistency and the freedom we all want from our business.</p>

<p class="section-title">Here’s what a few agents say about working with me…</p>

<p><span class="quote">"I had interviewed several brokers and agencies before I even got started in real estate.  I was looking for direction in getting started. I was looking for a broker who would teach me real estate. After I had got my license I spent the next year with 4 different brokerages. Every broker was a gifted sales person. All of them had sold me on how much time they would spend with me, teaching me real estate, building my pipeline, and contracts. After I got started with each of them it was apparent they were all there to just get my monthly fees. Learning was self taught.  But then I found Denise Swick. She has taught me more about this business in 60 days than I had learned the prior year. She works with me every single day on growing my business and expanding my knowledge in the real estate industry.  She is personally invested in my success. Denise is why I am still in the real estate industry with a positive outlook on my future success."  </span><br>

<p><span class="quote">"Working in another real estate office, I sought Denise out from her positive reputation and asked her advice on a few issues, she took the time to coach me once a week and this was several years ago. Denise Offers a common sense approach to selling while others try magic formulas or offer excuses, her common sense approach is unrivaled in today's market. As a new agent looking to gain knowledge or training let her 30+ years of experience guide you and keep you at the forefront in what is a competitive market. Others may promise you the world, but once you are signed up the cheerleaders disappear, mentors are scarce and you are left to fend for yourself."</span><br>

<p><span class="quote">"Here are a few things:<br>
1. The training and systems are in place in order for you to succeed at a high level, the only question you have to ask yourself is, Are you willing to do what it takes to have a life that you’ve always dreamed of?<br><br>

2. Training at a high level, so you can have the freedom that all agents talk about having, but very few have!<br><br>

3. If you are willing to take the time to write out, chant, role-play the necessary scripts, so that you can memorize and internalize them, and the objections that come with, on a daily basis…you can get the confidence to know that you can talk to fewer people to get qualified appointments! Which in return will get you contracts signed and commission checks!<br><br>

4. While the process may be tedious, mind numbing, and sometimes you may feel like you are making no progress….keep pushing, you are on your way to becoming a Great Agent! Nothing in life that is worth having or enjoying, comes without Hard Work!<br><br>

5. I promise, when you get into a rhythm….things will start happening. You will see appointments, better ratios in your prospecting, people will start dropping in your lap….I can’t explain it…IT JUST HAPPENS!<br><br>

6. With everything Denise has to offer, why would you want to work anywhere else….the training is the MAJOR KEY difference that sets us apart from the rest of the market. Its FREE! Take advantage of it and if you do, you just might be able to do all the things you have every wanted…..GO GET IT! It is up to you….it works if you work! I am not sure how to explain it…..It’s Hard work, but it’s not Hard work."</span><br>

<p>You don’t need to pay a bunch of money to a real estate coach.</p>

<p>Why am I offering this?</p>

<p>I’ll help you for free in return that maybe, over the long term – and only if it makes sense - you’d like to learn more about working on our team.</p>

<p>Let me be clear that is not the intent of the meeting. That’s another conversation for another time and only if you have any interest.</p>

<p>I also figure we’ll do business together someday and I would like to get to know you. I enjoy seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and I love it.</p>

<p><strong>I invite you to request a free one-on-one business strategy meeting with me.</strong> We can meet for coffee, or even if it’s more convenient, a phone call or a video conference works, too.</p>

<p>I have a questionnaire I would like you to fill out so that when we meet so I’m prepared to offer you specific advice. When you request a call, I’ll email it to you to complete before the meeting.</p>

<p>Look forward to meeting with you. Let’s grow your business.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Denise Swick</p>
